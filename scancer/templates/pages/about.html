      <h1>About This Project</h1>
      <p class="lead">Scancer is a collaborative effort to increase access to the early detection of breast cancer.</p>
      <p>Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer among women worldwide, accounting for 1 in 4 cancer cases. In 2020, there were an estimated 684,996 deaths from breast cancer, with a disproportionate number of these deaths occurring in low-resource settings.&nbsp;[1]</p>

      <p>Survival rates for breast cancer are very high when the cancer is detected early and where treatment is available. Unfortunately, 50 to 80% of breast cancer cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage in many low- and middle-income countries, when the cancer is usually incurable.&nbsp;[1]</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Diagnosis involves many stages, including manual exams, mammograms, MRIs, biopsies â€¦</li>
        <li>Many of these things are hard to do, and can be sped up with computer vision assisting human experts</li>
        <li>There exist many papers and models out there on bits and pieces of this, but no comprehensive solution (that we know of that) is clinically relevant</li>
        <li>Here is how we have chosen to structure our solution: plan, philosophy</li>
        <li>Some detailed notes and screenshots on what we have working so far, and pointers to GitHub repos</li>
        <li>Where we are going next and how you can help</li>
